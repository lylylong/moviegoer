# Moviegoer

## Description

Have you ever spent countless hours scrolling websites without being able to find any good movies? Well me too. With times like this, we need a reliable movie app where we can share between friends and still stay connected. Even if we can't see them in person, we can at least watch a movie with them.

The moviegoer app will allow you to find all kinds of movies, so you can share movies with friends, on top of that, you can enjoy searching effectively and saving search results.

The moviegoer app displays random new movies on our homepage, as a guest user you can search movies by name, see the trending and discover movies. There are more features for a login user, you can not only use the searching functions, but also save movies and build your own watchlist, view your watch list, and manage/remove movies from your watchlist.

The moviegoer app also shows you the movie details including movie release date and descriptions, as a movie fanatic, I can be able to view new movie options so that I won't miss any of them.
